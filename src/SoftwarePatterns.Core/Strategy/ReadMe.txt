Define:
	The strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a software design pattern, whereby an algorithm's behaviour can be selected at runtime. 
	The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

Intent:
	Encapsulates a family of related object or algorithms
	Lets the algorithm vary and evolve separate from the clients
	Allow classes to maintain a single purpose

Applicability 
	Switch statements are red flags
	Adding additional functionality forces you to modify an existing class
